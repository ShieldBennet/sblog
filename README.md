# Jituanlin's Blog

Welcome to jituanlin's blog!

I'm a programmer working on frontend development.

This blog serves as my platform for sharing thoughts and discoveries in the process of my learning journey.

I am employing the _output_ style method for better comprehension and retention.

Please note that due to the nature of this _"thinking out loud"_ approach, the information presented may not be perfectly structured.

Despite this, I hope the content remains insightful and valuable for those interested in:

- Functional programming
- Learning methodologies
- Frontend development
- Software engineering

Special thanks to [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) for the wonderful Astro theme.
